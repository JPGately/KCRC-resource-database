# KC Recovery Coalition: Resource Database 
The Kansas City Recovery Coalition (KCRC) is a network of treatment, prevention, and recovery support providers that work with individuals and their families seeking to overcome Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The KCRC team is developing an actionable referral database/mobile app which encompasses all SUD recovery and housing programs provided by agencies within the KC recovery support network. Whether used by the individual, a patient advocate, or counselor; the database/mobile app will reduce program placement time, broaden access to interagency resources, improve resource tracking, and provide a uniform presentation of participating agencies on a single platform. SUD not only deteriorates an individualâ€™s physical and mental well being, but severely impacts those closest to them and society as a whole. Join our team as we increase access to recovery resources to improve the lives of individuals effected by SUD and their families.
## Minimum Viable Solution
The first iteration could be a narrowing search database that generates a list of resource providers with link to member agency profiles which present "about" information on a uniform platform.
## Additional Opportunities
If there is a legal disclaimer or a data sharing method that was compliant with HIPAA, a single detox/transitional housing applicant portal for all member agencies would reduce cross agency application, promote interagency cooperation and improve resource tracking.
